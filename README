XPaint aims to provide a HTML5 based graphics application, just like paint on windows.

The target of XPaint is to research on the HTML5 canvas capacibility, see how it function in Windows 8 platform and Web Browsers with HTML5 supported.

The phase I mainly focus on Windows 8 platform, the projet is called XPaint.Win8, which is based on Windows 8 and the WinRT features.

The XPaint would provide following abilities:
  > Brush
  > Shapes
  > Eraser
  > History
  > Gallery
  > Share
  > Import
  > Export
  > Save
